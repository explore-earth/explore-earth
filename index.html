                <h4>Greetings</h4>
                <p>~Men shake hands when greeting one another, while maintaining steady eye contact.</p>
                <p>~Women generally kiss each other, starting with the left and alternating cheeks.</p>
                <p>~Hugging and backslapping are common greetings among Brazilian friends.</p>
                <p>~If a woman wishes to shake hands with a man, she should extend her hand first.</p>
                <p>~Personal space too is not the taboo it is in some countries and Brazilian people tend not to
                    be
                    uncomfortable when in close proximity with others .</p>

                <h4>Food</h4>
                <p>~Brazilians dress with flair and judge others on their appearance.</p>
                <p>~Casual dress is more formal than in many other countries. Always dress elegantly and err on
                    the
                    side of over-dressing rather than under- dressing.</p>
                <p>~Do not eat food with your hands - including fruit. Items such as fruit should be cut with a
                    knife
                    and fork.</p>
                <p>~The most honoured guest sits at the head of the table and hosts to sit either side.</p>
                <p>~If invited to a restaurant it is normally the person who offers the invitation who pays
                    although
                    it is important to make an offer to pay.</p>
                <p>~Brazilians often like to spend some time over a meal so expect to not rush off.</p>

                <h4>Gift Giving</h4>

                <p>~Avoid giving anything purple or black as these are mourning colours.</p>
                <p>~Since handkerchiefs are associated with funerals they do not make good gifts.</p>

                    country
                    and raising religion in conversation particularly if expressing any strong atheistic views
                    is a
                    definite no-no.</p>

                <p>~Brazilians prefer face-to-face meetings to written communication as it allows them to know
                    the
                    person
                    with whom they are doing business.</p>
                <p>~Be courteous and do not openly criticise particularly in a group situation as this will cause
                    offence.</p>
                <p>~It is not frowned upon to interrupt someone when they are speaking as long as it is within
                    context of
                    the discussion and not to overtly disagree or criticise.</p>
                <p>~Brazilians are very much in favour of properly drawn up legal documents.</p>

                <h4>What to Wear</h4>
                <p>~The key to dress code in Brazil is to know the company with whom you are dealing. Some are
                    more
                    conservative than others but remember, the Brazilians are very proud of their appearance and
                    being
                    well dressed will earn respect.</p>

                <h4>Titles</h4>
                <p>~The formal way to greet a man is Senhor and Senhora for women. Single women and younger women
                    should
                    be greeted as Senhorita</p>

                <h4>Meetings</h4>
                <p>~Do not appear impatient if you are kept waiting. Brazilians see time as something outside
                    their
                    control and the demands of relationships takes precedence over adhering to a strict
                    schedule.

                <h4>Negotiating</h4>
                <p>~Expect questions about your company since Brazilians are more comfortable doing business with
                    people
                    and companies they know.</p>
                <p>~Wait for your Brazilian colleagues to raise the business subject. Never rush the
                    relationship-
                    building time.</p>
                <p>~Brazilians take time when negotiating. Do not rush them or appear impatient.</p>
                <p>~Expect a great deal of time to be spent reviewing details. Often the people you negotiate
                    with
                    will
                    not have decision-making authority.</p>

            <h3 class="country-head">Japan's Social Etiquettes</h3>
            <div id="customsGreetings">
                <h4>Greetings</h4>
                <p>~Greetings in Japan are very formal and ritualized. It is important to show the correct amount
                    of
                    respect and deference to someone based upon their status relative to your own.</p>
                <p>~Wait to be introduced. It is considered impolite to introduce yourself, even in a large
                    gathering.
                </p>
                <p>~While foreigners are expected to shake hands, the traditional form of greeting is the bow.
                    How
                    far
                    you bow depends upon your relationship to the other person as well as the situation. The
                    deeper
                    you
                    bow, the more respect you show.</p>
                <p>~A foreign visitor ('gaijin') may bow the head slightly, since no one expects foreigners to
                    generally
                    understand the subtle nuances of bowing.</p>
                <p>~The Japanese prefer to have some distance, at least arms-length in their personal space.</p>

                    shoes
                    pointing away from the doorway you are about to walk through.</p>
                <p>~Arrive on time or no more than 5 minutes late if invited for dinner. Unless you have been
                    told
                    the
                    event is casual, dress as if you were going into the office.</p>
                <p>~If you use the toilet, put on the available toilet slippers and remove them when you are
                    finished. Do
                    not wear them back out of the bathroom.</p>
                <p>~Wait to be told where to sit. There is a protocol to be followed. The honoured guest or the
                    eldest
                    person will be seated in the centre of the table the furthest from the door.</p>
                <p>~The honoured guest or the eldest is the first person to begin eating.</p>
                <p>~It will yield tremendous dividends if you learn to use chopsticks. Never point your
                    chopsticks.
                    Chopsticks should be returned to the chopstick rest after every few bites and when you drink
                    or
                    stop
                    to speak. Do not cross your chopsticks when putting them on the chopstick rest.</p>
                <p>~Don't be surprised if your Japanese colleagues slurp their noodles and soup.</p>
                <p>~Mixing other food with rice is usually not done. You eat a bit of one and then a bit of the
                    other,
                    but they should never be mixed together as you do in many Western countries.</p>
                <p>~If you do not want anything more to drink, do not finish what is in your glass. An empty
                    glass is
                    an
                    invitation for someone to serve you more.</p>
                <p>~If you leave a small amount of rice in your bowl, you will be given more. To signify that you
                    do
                    not
                    want more rice, finish every grain in your bowl.</p>

                <h4>Communication</h4>
                <p>~The Japanese rely on facial expression, tone of voice and posture to tell them what someone
                    feels.
                    They often trust non-verbal messages more than the spoken word as words can have several
                    meanings.
                </p>
                <p>~Frowning while someone is speaking is interpreted as a sign of disagreement. Most Japanese
                    maintain
                    an impassive expression when speaking.</p>
                <p>~Non-verbal communication is so vital that there is a book for 'gaijins' (foreigners) on how
                    to
                    interpret the signs!</p>
                <p>~It is considered disrespectful to stare into another person's eyes, particularly those of a
                    person
                    who is senior to you because of age or status.</p>
                <p>~In crowded situations the Japanese avoid eye contact to give themselves privacy.</p>

                <h4>Gift Giving</h4>
                <p>~In Japan, gift-giving is highly ritualistic and meaningful. The ceremony of presenting the
                    gift
                    and
                    the way in which it is wrapped is as important, and sometimes more important, than the gift
                    itself.
                </p>
                <p>~Do not give lilies, camellias or lotus blossoms as they are associated with funerals and
                    avoid
                    white
                    flowers of any kind as they are associated with funerals.</p>
                <p>~Do not give potted plants as they encourage sickness, although a bonsai tree is always
                    acceptable.
                </p>
                <p>~Give items in odd numbers, but not 9 (the numbers 9 and 4 are considered unlucky in Japan)

                    your

                <h4>What to Wear</h4>

                    months
                    with white shirt and tie that is not brightly coloured.</p>

                    grey
                    suits.</p>
                <p>~Women should also dress conservatively, wear hair either short or tied back. Conspicuous
                    jewellery or
                    short skirts are not considered appropriate. </p>

                </p>
                <p>~Punctuality is important. Arrive on time for meetings and expect your Japanese colleagues
                    will do
                    the
                    same.</p>
                <p>~Since this is a group society, even if you think you will be meeting one person, be prepared
                    for
                    a
                    group meeting.</p>
                <p>~The most senior Japanese person will be seated furthest from the door, with the rest of the
                    people in
                    descending rank until the most junior person is seated closest to the door.</p>
                <p>~It may take several meetings for your Japanese counterparts to become comfortable with you
                    and be
                    able to conduct business with you. This initial getting to know you time is crucial to
                    laying
                    the
                    foundation for a successful relationship.</p>
                <p>~Never refuse a request, no matter how difficult or non- profitable it may appear. The
                    Japanese
                    are
                    looking for a long-term relationship.</p>
                <p>~Always provide a package of literature about your company including articles and client
                    testimonials.
                </p>
                <p>~Always give a small gift, as a token of your esteem, and present it to the most senior person
                    at
                    the
                    end of the meeting. Your Japanese contact can advise you on where to find something

                <p>~Materials should be handed to the participants of the meeting rather than the more casual
                    practice of
                    ‘taking one and passing it on’.</p>
                <p>~Make sure the time schedule allows for questions and remember, the Japanese do not always

                    their
                    hands and will often look directly at you instead. It is up to the presenter to be aware and

                    at observing their non-verbal communication.</p>
                <p>~It is best to phrase questions so that they can answer yes. For example, do you disagree with
                    this?
                </p>
                <p>~The Japanese often remain silent for long periods of time. Be patient and try to work out if
                    your
                    Japanese colleagues have understood what was said.</p>
                <p>~Japanese prefer broad agreements and mutual understanding so that when problems arise they
                    can be
                    handled flexibly.</p>
                <p>~Some Japanese close their eyes when they want to listen intently.</p>
                <p>~The Japanese do not see contracts as final agreements so they can be renegotiated.</p>

                <h4>Greetings</h4>
                <p>~A long but steady handshake is common. Ensure you only use your right hand.</p>
                <p>~Arab men or women may decline to shake the hands of those from the other sex. This is a
                    religious
                    adherence practiced by many male and female Muslims. It is not personal and it should not be
                    taken
                    offensively. We suggest therefore, that men wait to see if a female offers her hand prior to
                    offering his. </p>
                <p>~Likewise, if a female offers her hand and it is refused by a male, then we suggest the use of
                    a
                    gesture that is often used across the Muslim world as an alternative greeting whereby the
                    right
                    hand
                    is placed flat over the heart, coupled with a brief nod of the head and a smile.</p>
                <p>~It is polite to greet the oldest or most senior members of the group first.</p>
                <p>~Maintain eye contact with people of the same sex.</p>
                <p>~It is not uncommon for men to greet other men with a kiss or a nose rub. Male friends often
                    link
                    arms
                    or hold hands.</p>
                <p>~Members of the opposite sex do not embrace or kiss in public.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="customsFood">
                <h4>Food</h4>
                <p>~Dining in the UAE is a very social affair and can be a means to doing business also.</p>
                <p>~It is considered polite to arrive fifteen minutes late.</p>
                <p>~Expect to eat with the right hand – the left hand is considered dirty. However, if you are
                    left
                    handed it is acceptable to eat with a utensil in the left hand. Arabs may eat with their
                    hand
                    only
                    and without utensils. Hand cleanliness is therefore very important. </p>
                <p>~It is not considered polite to decline the offer of more food.</p>
                <p>~If dining in a restaurant give more than the service charge – up to 10% is acceptable.</p>
            </div>

            <div id="customsTaboos">
                <h4>Taboos</h4>
                <p>~Do not discuss religion or criticise Islam.</p>
                <p>~Men should not stare at women or offer compliments</p>
                <p>~Do not go outside scantily dressed</p>
                <p>~Non-Muslims should not enter a mosque or touch a Qu’ran</p>
                <p>~Kissing or cuddling in public is strictly prohibited and such conduct can result in arrest.

                <p>~Government office hours are typically between 07:30 and 15:00, although private office hours
                    are
                    typically open for longer and often finish as late as 21:00. However, where this is the
                    case, a
                    three to four-hour break at some point in the day is given.</p>

                    to,
                    gently and politely, reinforce any deadlines.</p>
                <p>~Do not question the boss in a way that puts him / her on the spot as this will potentially

                    An

                    may

                    it’s
                    unlikely that they will trust you sufficiently to negotiate with you.</p>
                <p>~Any business agreements should be passed by a lawyer before signing on the dotted line.</p>
                <p>~If there is some doubt about the outcome of negotiations this should not be expressed too
                    negatively
                    and the word ‘no’ is best avoided.</p>
                <p>~Do not use high pressure tactics as these will not be tolerated and are likely to negatively
                    impact

                <h4>Communication</h4>
                <p>~Small talk is common, indeed expected, and is often the prelude to business discussion.</p>
                <p>~Business is conducted on the basis of trust in the UAE and will fall short if individuals try
                    to
                    hurry on to business matters to hastily. Take the time to get to know your counterpart by
                    asking
                    generic questions and showing an interest in them personally. Ask about their children,
                    their

                    person.</p>
                <p>~Spanish people are open and friendly. In an informal situation whether with family close

                    or say good-bye with a hug (abrazo).</p>

                <h4>Meetings</h4>
                <p>~Several people may speak at once. You may be interrupted while you are speaking although this
                    should
                    not be seen as an insult. It often means that they are interested in what you are saying.
                </p>
                <p>~Decisions are not necessarily reached. Meetings are for discussion and to exchange ideas.</p>
                <p>~Most Spaniards do not give their opinion at meetings. Therefore, it is important to watch

                </p>
                <p>~Hierarchy and rank are important. You should deal with people of similar rank to your own.
                </p>
                <p>~Spaniards do not like to lose face, so they will not necessarily say that they do not
                    understand
                    something, particularly if you are not speaking Spanish. You must be adept at discerning

                    language.</p>
                <p>~Spaniards are very thorough. They will review every minute detail to make certain it is

                    rules of
                    protocol. Any form of confrontation is not acceptable and should be avoided.</p>
                <p>~Spanish people are proud and very protective of their standing and how others perceive them.

                <p>~Boasting of achievement and personal accomplishment should be avoided.</p>
                <p>~Spanish people tend to be extrovert and friendly as is typical in Mediterranean culture and
                    they

                    to start.</p>
                <p>~Do not rest your elbows on the table, although your hands should be visible at all times.</p>
                <p>~You will often be urged to take second helpings.</p>

                <p>~Men pour drinks for women seated next to them.</p>
                <p>~Leaving a small amount of food on your plate indicates that your hosts have provided ample
                    hospitality.</p>
                <p>~Do not get up until you are invited to leave the table. At formal dinners, the guest of honor

                    bring flowers.</p>
                <p>~Russians often protest when they are offered a gift. Reply that it is a little something and
                    offer the gift again and it will generally be accepted.</p>
                <p>~Do not give yellow flowers.</p>

                <p>~It often takes roughly 6 weeks to arrange a meeting with a government official.</p>
                <p>~The first week of May has several public holidays so it is best avoided.</p>
                <p>~The first meeting is often a vehicle to determine if you and the company you represent are
                    credible and worthy of consideration for future business dealings.</p>
                <p>~Russians expect long and detailed presentations that include a history of the subject and a
                    review of existing precedents.</p>
                <p>~Meetings are frequently interrupted. It is common for several side conversations that have

                <p>~At the end of the meeting, expect to sign a 'protokol', which is a summary of what was

            </div>
            <div id="customsCommuniction">
                <h4>Communication</h4>
                <p>~Russians are transactional and do not need to establish long-standing personal relationships
                    before they do business with people. It is still a good idea to develop a network of people
                    who
                    you know and trust. The Russian word "svyasi" means connections and refers to having friends
                    in
                    high places, which is often required to cut through red tape.</p>
                <p>~Patience is essential.</p>
                <p>~Sincerity is crucial as it is required to build trust, and trust is needed to build a
                    relationship.
                </p>
                <p>~Most Russians do not trust people who are 'all business'.</p>
                <p>~An indication that you have successfully developed a personal relationship is being asked for
                    a
                    favour by that person.</p>

            </div>
            <div id="customsNegotiating">
                <h4>Negotiating</h4>
                <p>~Meetings and negotiations are slow. Russians do not like being rushed.</p>
                <p>~It is a good idea to include technical experts on your negotiating team.</p>
                <p>~Hierarchy is important to Russians. They respect age, rank and position. The most senior
                    person
                    reaches decisions. Russian executives prefer to meet with people of similar rank and
                    position.
                </p>
                <p>~Russians see negotiations as win-lose. They do not believe in win-win scenarios.</p>
                <p>~Russians view compromise as weakness. They will continue negotiating until you offer
                    concessions.
                </p>
                <p>~Russians may lose their temper, walk out of the meeting, or threaten to terminate the
                    relationship in an attempt to coerce you to change your position.</p>
                <p>~Russians often use time as a tactic, especially if they know that you have a deadline. Be
                    cautious about letting your business colleagues know that you are under time pressure or
                    they
                    will delay even more.</p>
                <p>~Nothing is final until the contract is signed. Even then, Russians will modify a contract to
                    suit
                    their purposes.</p>
                <p>~Do not use high-pressure sales tactics as they will work against you.</p>
