                <p>Time Zone: Brazil is a vast country with four standard time zones which are as follows: UTC â€“ 2.00,
                    03.00, 04.00, 05.00. </p>

                <p>Family is of paramount importance to the Brazilian people and grown up children often remain with

                    <h4>Meeting & Greeting</h4>
                    <p>Men shake hands when greeting one another, while maintaining steady eye contact.</p>
                    <p>Women generally kiss each other, starting with the left and alternating cheeks.</p>
                    <p>Hugging and backslapping are common greetings among Brazilian friends.</p>
                    <p>If a woman wishes to shake hands with a man, she should extend her hand first.</p>
                </div>
                <div id="personal">
                    <h4>Personal Space</h4>
                    <p>Personal space too is not the taboo it is in some countries and Brazilian people tend not to be
                        uncomfortable when in close proximity with others .</p>
                </div>
                <div id="gifts">
                    <h4>Gift Giving</h4>
                    <p>If invited to a Brazilian's house, bring the hostess flowers or a small gift.</p>
                    <p>Avoid giving anything purple or black as these are mourning colours.</p>
                    <p>Since handkerchiefs are associated with funerals they do not make good gifts.</p>
                </div>
                <div id="food">
                    <h4>Dining & Food</h4>
                    <p>Brazilians dress with flair and judge others on their appearance.</p>
                    <p>Casual dress is more formal than in many other countries. Always dress elegantly and err on the
                        side of over-dressing rather than under- dressing.</p>
                    <p>Do not eat food with your hands - including fruit. Items such as fruit should be cut with a knife
                        and fork.</p>
                    <p>The most honoured guest sits at the head of the table and hosts to sit either side.</p>
                    <p>If invited to a restaurant it is normally the person who offers the invitation who pays although
                        it is important to make an offer to pay.</p>
                    <p>Brazilians often like to spend some time over a meal so expect to not rush off.</p>
                </div>
                <div id="taboos">
                    <h4>Taboos</h4>
                    <p>Although the Brazilians are typically tolerant people bear in mind that it is a Catholic country
                        and raising religion in conversation particularly if expressing any strong atheistic views is a
                        definite no-no.</p>

            <h3 class="country-head">Business Etiquette</h3>
            <div id="business-basics">
                <p>Brazilians prefer face-to-face meetings to written communication as it allows them to know the person
                    with whom they are doing business.</p>
                <p>Be courteous and do not openly criticise particularly in a group situation as this will cause
                    offence.</p>
                <p>It is not frowned upon to interrupt someone when they are speaking as long as it is within context of
                    the discussion and not to overtly disagree or criticise.</p>
                <p>Brazilians are very much in favour of properly drawn up legal documents.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="dress">
                <h4>What to Wear</h4>
                <p>The key to dress code in Brazil is to know the company with whom you are dealing. Some are more
                    conservative than others but remember, the Brazilians are very proud of their appearance and being
                    well dressed will earn respect.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="titles">
                <h4>Titles</h4>
                <p>The formal way to greet a man is Senhor and Senhora for women. Single women and younger women should
                    be greeted as Senhorita</p>
            </div>
            <div id="meetings">
                <h4>Meetings</h4>
                <p>Do not appear impatient if you are kept waiting. Brazilians see time as something outside their
                    control and the demands of relationships takes precedence over adhering to a strict schedule.</p>
                <p>Expect to be interrupted while you are speaking or making a presentation.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="negotiating">
                <h4>Negotiating</h4>
                <p>Expect questions about your company since Brazilians are more comfortable doing business with people
                    and companies they know.</p>
                <p>Wait for your Brazilian colleagues to raise the business subject. Never rush the relationship-
                    building time.</p>
                <p>Brazilians take time when negotiating. Do not rush them or appear impatient.</p>
                <p>Expect a great deal of time to be spent reviewing details. Often the people you negotiate with will
                    not have decision-making authority.</p>
                <p>It is advisable to hire a translator if your Portuguese is not fluent.</p>

            <div class="info">

                <div id="meet-greet">
                    <h4>Meeting & Greeting</h4>
                    <p>Greetings in Japan are very formal and ritualized. It is important to show the correct amount of
                        respect and deference to someone based upon their status relative to your own.</p>
                    <p>Wait to be introduced. It is considered impolite to introduce yourself, even in a large
                        gathering.</p>
                    <p>While foreigners are expected to shake hands, the traditional form of greeting is the bow. How
                        far you bow depends upon your relationship to the other person as well as the situation. The
                        deeper
                        you bow, the more respect you show.</p>
                    <p>A foreign visitor ('gaijin') may bow the head slightly, since no one expects foreigners to
                        generally understand the subtle nuances of bowing.</p>
                </div>
                <div id="communication">
                    <h4>Communication</h4>
                    <p>The Japanese rely on facial expression, tone of voice and posture to tell them what someone
                        feels.
                        They often trust non-verbal messages more than the spoken word as words can have several
                        meanings.
                    </p>
                    <p>Frowning while someone is speaking is interpreted as a sign of disagreement. Most Japanese
                        maintain
                        an impassive expression when speaking.</p>
                    <p>Non-verbal communication is so vital that there is a book for 'gaijins' (foreigners) on how to
                        interpret the signs!</p>
                    <p>It is considered disrespectful to stare into another person's eyes, particularly those of a
                        person
                        who is senior to you because of age or status.</p>
                    <p>In crowded situations the Japanese avoid eye contact to give themselves privacy.</p>
                </div>
                <div id="personal">
                    <h4>Personal Space</h4>
                    <p>The Japanese prefer to have some distance, at least arms-length in their personal space.</p>
                </div>
                <div id="gifts">
                    <h4>Gift Giving</h4>
                    <p>In Japan, gift-giving is highly ritualistic and meaningful. The ceremony of presenting the gift
                        and
                        the way in which it is wrapped is as important, and sometimes more important, than the gift
                        itself.
                    </p>
                    <p>Do not give lilies, camellias or lotus blossoms as they are associated with funerals and avoid
                        white
                        flowers of any kind as they are associated with funerals.</p>
                    <p>Do not give potted plants as they encourage sickness, although a bonsai tree is always
                        acceptable.
                    </p>
                    <p>Give items in odd numbers, but not 9 (the numbers 9 and 4 are considered unlucky in Japan)</p>


                </div>
                <div id="food">
                    <h4>Dining & Food</h4>
                    <p>On the rare occasion you are invited to a Japanese house: </p>
                    <p>Remove your shoes before entering and put on the slippers left at the doorway. Leave your shoes
                        pointing away from the doorway you are about to walk through.</p>
                    <p>Arrive on time or no more than 5 minutes late if invited for dinner. Unless you have been told
                        the
                        event is casual, dress as if you were going into the office.</p>
                    <p>If you use the toilet, put on the available toilet slippers and remove them when you are
                        finished. Do
                        not wear them back out of the bathroom.</p>
                    <p>Wait to be told where to sit. There is a protocol to be followed. The honoured guest or the
                        eldest
                        person will be seated in the centre of the table the furthest from the door.</p>
                    <p>The honoured guest or the eldest is the first person to begin eating.</p>
                    <p>It will yield tremendous dividends if you learn to use chopsticks. Never point your chopsticks.
                        Chopsticks should be returned to the chopstick rest after every few bites and when you drink or
                        stop
                        to speak. Do not cross your chopsticks when putting them on the chopstick rest.</p>
                    <p>Don't be surprised if your Japanese colleagues slurp their noodles and soup.</p>
                    <p>Mixing other food with rice is usually not done. You eat a bit of one and then a bit of the
                        other,
                        but they should never be mixed together as you do in many Western countries.</p>
                    <p>If you do not want anything more to drink, do not finish what is in your glass. An empty glass is
                        an
                        invitation for someone to serve you more.</p>
                    <p>If you leave a small amount of rice in your bowl, you will be given more. To signify that you do
                        not
                        want more rice, finish every grain in your bowl.</p>

                    <p>Business cards are exchanged constantly and with great ceremony. Invest in quality cards.</p>
                    <p>Treat the business card you receive as you would the person. It is wise to have one side of
                        your
                        business card translated into Japanese.</p>
                    <p>Business cards are given and received with two hands and a slight bow.</p>
                </div>
                <div id="dress">
                    <h4>What to Wear</h4>
                    <p>It is important to dress smartly and conservatively. Men should wear a dark suit in the
                        winter
                        months with white shirt and tie that is not brightly coloured.</p>
                    <p>As the summer months can be very hot it is acceptable to wear half sleeve shirts and light
                        grey
                        suits.</p>
                    <p>Women should also dress conservatively, wear hair either short or tied back. Conspicuous
                        jewellery or short skirts are not considered appropriate. </p>

                </div>

                <div id="meetings">
                    <h4>Meetings</h4>
                    <p>Appointments are required and, whenever possible, should be made several weeks in advance.
                    </p>
                    <p>Punctuality is important. Arrive on time for meetings and expect your Japanese colleagues
                        will do
                        the same.</p>
                    <p>Since this is a group society, even if you think you will be meeting one person, be prepared
                        for
                        a group meeting.</p>
                    <p>The most senior Japanese person will be seated furthest from the door, with the rest of the
                        people in descending rank until the most junior person is seated closest to the door.</p>
                    <p>It may take several meetings for your Japanese counterparts to become comfortable with you
                        and be
                        able to conduct business with you. This initial getting to know you time is crucial to
                        laying
                        the foundation for a successful relationship.</p>
                    <p>Never refuse a request, no matter how difficult or non- profitable it may appear. The
                        Japanese
                        are looking for a long-term relationship.</p>
                    <p>Always provide a package of literature about your company including articles and client
                        testimonials.</p>
                    <p>Always give a small gift, as a token of your esteem, and present it to the most senior person
                        at
                        the end of the meeting. Your Japanese contact can advise you on where to find something
                        appropriate.</p>
                </div>
                <div id="presentations">
                    <h4>Presentations</h4>
                    <p>Keep them formal and stick to the facts. Donâ€™t try to impress with gimmicky designs.</p>
                    <p>Materials should be handed to the participants of the meeting rather than the more casual
                        practice of â€˜taking one and passing it onâ€™.</p>
                    <p>Make sure the time schedule allows for questions and remember, the Japanese do not always
                        raise
                        their hands and will often look directly at you instead. It is up to the presenter to be
                        aware
                        and to politely ask if they wish to ask a question.</p>

                    <p>The Japanese are non-confrontational. They have a difficult time saying 'no', so you must be
                        vigilant at observing their non-verbal communication.</p>
                    <p>It is best to phrase questions so that they can answer yes. For example, do you disagree with
                        this?</p>
                    <p>The Japanese often remain silent for long periods of time. Be patient and try to work out if
                        your
                        Japanese colleagues have understood what was said.</p>
                    <p>Japanese prefer broad agreements and mutual understanding so that when problems arise they
                        can be
                        handled flexibly.</p>
                    <p>Some Japanese close their eyes when they want to listen intently.</p>
                    <p>The Japanese do not see contracts as final agreements so they can be renegotiated.</p>

                    <h4>Management</h4>
                    <p>The hierarchal structure in business management is the essence of corporate culture in Japan.
                        Each person is clear about their role and functionality within the business. </p>
                    <p>Managers are not expected to engage their reports in decision making. Indeed, deferring
                        decisions, or blanket inclusion in decision making may be viewed as a sign of weakness</p>
                    <p>The concept of â€˜faceâ€™ is important in Japan and, as such, Managers will be careful to protect
                        the
                        reputation of subordinates when in the presence of others. Critical remarks are certainly
                        not
                        voiced in public and a Manager may even appear to overtly agree with something that they
                        disagree with in an effort to save the face of others.</p>

                        father, then followed again by ibn meaning the name of the father of his father. This is then

                    <h4>Meeting & Greeting</h4>
                    <p>A long but steady handshake is common. Ensure you only use your right hand.</p>
                    <p>Arab men or women may decline to shake the hands of those from the other sex. This is a religious
                        adherence practiced by many male and female Muslims. It is not personal and it should not be
                        taken offensively. We suggest therefore, that men wait to see if a female offers her hand prior
                        to offering his. </p>
                    <p>Likewise, if a female offers her hand and it is refused by a male, then we suggest the use of a
                        gesture that is often used across the Muslim world as an alternative greeting whereby the right
                        hand is placed flat over the heart, coupled with a brief nod of the head and a smile.</p>
                    <p>It is polite to greet the oldest or most senior members of the group first.</p>

                    <h4>Communication Style</h4>
                    <p>Small talk is common, indeed expected, and is often the prelude to business discussion.</p>
                    <p>Business is conducted on the basis of trust in the UAE and will fall short if individuals try to
                        hurry on to business matters to hastily. Take the time to get to know your counterpart by asking
                        generic questions and showing an interest in them personally. Ask about their children, their
                        school, sporting interests, trips abroad etc. </p>
                    <p>Be aware of hierarchal structures and show due respect to those in a higher position. Use titles
                        where appropriate.</p>
                    <p>Never criticize Islam, the ruling classes or local traditions. Never sit in a position that shows
                        the soles of the feet. To do so is an insult as feet are considered dirty.</p>

                    <h4>Personal Space</h4>

                    <p>Men should show courtesy and respect for women. Never make prolonged eye contact with a woman or
                        compliment her on her appearance or dress. </p>
                    <p>It is not uncommon for men to greet other men with a kiss or a nose rub. Male friends often link
                        arms or hold hands.</p>
                    <p>Members of the opposite sex do not embrace or kiss in public.</p>

                    <h4>Gift Giving</h4>
                    <p>All gifts should be of a high quality. Good perfume is acceptable even for men who take a pride
                        in the appearance and status but such a gift for a woman should only be given by another woman.
                    </p>
                    <p>Gifts with a personal touch that show thoughtfulness are very acceptable.</p>

                    <p>It is considered polite to arrive fifteen minutes late.</p>
                    <p>Expect to eat with the right hand â€“ the left hand is considered dirty. However, if you are left
                        handed it is acceptable to eat with a utensil in the left hand. Arabs may eat with their hand
                        only and without utensils. Hand cleanliness is therefore very important. </p>
                    <p>It is not considered polite to decline the offer of more food.</p>
                    <p>If dining in a restaurant give more than the service charge â€“ up to 10% is acceptable.</p>

                        with whom you do business.It is polite for instance, to address the head of the department or
                        company as â€˜Sheikhâ€™.</p>

                    <p>Punctuality is important and deemed respectful.</p>
                    <p>It is not unusual for meetings to seem a little disorganised and interruptions are not uncommon.
                        An individual unrelated to the meeting may therefore join the meeting for a period and the
                        subject may change accordingly. You may also find that some individuals make or receive calls

                <div id="negotiating">
                    <p>Building relations in UAE and personal contacts are paramount to successful business. If you have
                        not taken the time and made the effort to build a positive relationship with your counterpart
                        then itâ€™s unlikely that they will trust you sufficiently to negotiate with you.</p>
                    <p>Any business agreements should be passed by a lawyer before signing on the dotted line.</p>
                    <p>If there is some doubt about the outcome of negotiations this should not be expressed too
                        negatively and the word â€˜noâ€™ is best avoided.</p>
                    <p>Do not use high pressure tactics as these will not be tolerated and are likely to negatively
                        impact proceedings.</p>

                </div>
                <div id="management">
                    <p>Be aware that the work week in the UAE runs from Sunday to Thursday. Friday and Saturday are
                        weekend days.</p>
                    <p>Government office hours are typically between 07:30 and 15:00, although private office hours are
                        typically open for longer and often finish as late as 21:00. However, where this is the case, a
                        three to four-hour break at some point in the day is given.</p>
                    <p>Although timescales and deadlines are broadly adhered to, less priority is given to them compared
                        to Western cultures. If therefore, you are a Westerner doing business in the UAE, then you may
                        wish to, gently and politely, reinforce any deadlines.</p>
                    <p>Do not question the boss in a way that puts him / her on the spot as this will potentially cause
                        a loss of face and will not be well received.</p>

                    <p>t is not advisable to give chrysanthemums, white lilies or red roses and flowers should be in odd
                        numbers except for 13 which is seen as an unlucky number.</p>
                    <p>If receiving a gift it should be opened immediately in the presence of the giver.</p>

                    <p>Always keep your hands visible when eating. Keep your wrists resting on the edge of the table.
                    </p>
                    <p>Do not begin eating until the hostess starts. The host gives the first toast. An honoured guest
                        should return the toast later in the meal.</p>
                    <p>Indicate you have finished eating by laying your knife and fork parallel on your plate, tines
                        facing up, with the handles facing to the right.</p>
                    <p>Do not get up until the guest of honour does.</p>

                    <p>Do not expect dinner in the evening to be any time before 9pm.</p>
                    <p>Do not plan anything for a Tuesday 13th as this is seen as an unlucky date.</p>

                    <p>First names only are used when addressing family, friends and children.</p>
                    <p>In business settings, it is recommended that you address your counterparts with â€˜seÃ±orâ€™, â€˜seÃ±oraâ€™
                        or â€˜seÃ±oritaâ€™ for men, women or unmarried women respectively.</p>
                    <p>When addressing a professional then use titles where appropriate (e.g. doctor / professor). It is
                        not necessary to use titles however, when addressing Spanish business counterparts.</p>

                    <p>Several people may speak at once. You may be interrupted while you are speaking although this
                        should not be seen as an insult. It often means that they are interested in what you are saying.
                    </p>
                    <p>Decisions are not necessarily reached. Meetings are for discussion and to exchange ideas.</p>
                    <p>Most Spaniards do not give their opinion at meetings. Therefore, it is important to watch their
                        non-verbal communication.</p>

                    <p>Hierarchy and rank are important. You should deal with people of similar rank to your own.</p>
                    <p>Spaniards do not like to lose face, so they will not necessarily say that they do not understand
                        something, particularly if you are not speaking Spanish. You must be adept at discerning body
                        language.</p>
                    <p>Spaniards are very thorough. They will review every minute detail to make certain it is
                        understood.</p>
