                    <h4>Greetings</h4>
                    <p>Men shake hands when greeting one another, while maintaining steady eye contact.</p>
                    <p>Women generally kiss each other, starting with the left and alternating cheeks.</p>
                    <p>Hugging and backslapping are common greetings among Brazilian friends.</p>
                    <p>If a woman wishes to shake hands with a man, she should extend her hand first.</p>
                    <p>Personal space too is not the taboo it is in some countries and Brazilian people tend not to be
                        uncomfortable when in close proximity with others .</p>

                    <h4>Food</h4>
                    <p>Brazilians dress with flair and judge others on their appearance.</p>
                    <p>Casual dress is more formal than in many other countries. Always dress elegantly and err on the
                        side of over-dressing rather than under- dressing.</p>
                    <p>Do not eat food with your hands - including fruit. Items such as fruit should be cut with a knife
                        and fork.</p>
                    <p>The most honoured guest sits at the head of the table and hosts to sit either side.</p>
                    <p>If invited to a restaurant it is normally the person who offers the invitation who pays although
                        it is important to make an offer to pay.</p>
                    <p>Brazilians often like to spend some time over a meal so expect to not rush off.</p>
                </div>
                <div id="customsGifts">
                    <h4>Gift Giving</h4>
                    <p>If invited to a Brazilian's house, bring the hostess flowers or a small gift.</p>
                    <p>Avoid giving anything purple or black as these are mourning colours.</p>
                    <p>Since handkerchiefs are associated with funerals they do not make good gifts.</p>
                </div>
                <div id="customsTaboos">
                    <h4>Cultural Taboos</h4>
                    <p>Although the Brazilians are typically tolerant people bear in mind that it is a Catholic country
                        and raising religion in conversation particularly if expressing any strong atheistic views is a
                        definite no-no.</p>

                <div id="business-basics">
                    <p>Brazilians prefer face-to-face meetings to written communication as it allows them to know the
                        person
                        with whom they are doing business.</p>
                    <p>Be courteous and do not openly criticise particularly in a group situation as this will cause
                        offence.</p>
                    <p>It is not frowned upon to interrupt someone when they are speaking as long as it is within
                        context of
                        the discussion and not to overtly disagree or criticise.</p>
                    <p>Brazilians are very much in favour of properly drawn up legal documents.</p>
                </div>
                <div id="customsDress">
                    <h4>What to Wear</h4>
                    <p>The key to dress code in Brazil is to know the company with whom you are dealing. Some are more
                        conservative than others but remember, the Brazilians are very proud of their appearance and
                        being
                        well dressed will earn respect.</p>
                </div>
                <div id="customsTitles">
                    <h4>Titles</h4>
                    <p>The formal way to greet a man is Senhor and Senhora for women. Single women and younger women
                        should
                        be greeted as Senhorita</p>
                </div>
                <div id="customsMeetings">
                    <h4>Meetings</h4>
                    <p>Do not appear impatient if you are kept waiting. Brazilians see time as something outside their
                        control and the demands of relationships takes precedence over adhering to a strict schedule.
                    </p>
                    <p>Expect to be interrupted while you are speaking or making a presentation.</p>
                </div>
                <div id="customsNegotiating">
                    <h4>Negotiating</h4>
                    <p>Expect questions about your company since Brazilians are more comfortable doing business with
                        people
                        and companies they know.</p>
                    <p>Wait for your Brazilian colleagues to raise the business subject. Never rush the relationship-
                        building time.</p>
                    <p>Brazilians take time when negotiating. Do not rush them or appear impatient.</p>
                    <p>Expect a great deal of time to be spent reviewing details. Often the people you negotiate with
                        will
                        not have decision-making authority.</p>
                    <p>It is advisable to hire a translator if your Portuguese is not fluent.</p>

    <!-- JAPAN CUSTOMS -->
    <div class="row country-container" id="japan">
        <div class="col-md-6">
            <h3 class="country-head">Social Etiquette</h3>
            <div id="customsGreetings">
                <h4>Greetings</h4>
                <p>Greetings in Japan are very formal and ritualized. It is important to show the correct amount of
                    respect and deference to someone based upon their status relative to your own.</p>
                <p>Wait to be introduced. It is considered impolite to introduce yourself, even in a large gathering.
                </p>
                <p>While foreigners are expected to shake hands, the traditional form of greeting is the bow. How far
                    you bow depends upon your relationship to the other person as well as the situation. The deeper you
                    bow, the more respect you show.</p>
                <p>A foreign visitor ('gaijin') may bow the head slightly, since no one expects foreigners to generally
                    understand the subtle nuances of bowing.</p>
                <p>The Japanese prefer to have some distance, at least arms-length in their personal space.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="customsFood">
                <h4>Food</h4>
                <p>On the rare occasion you are invited to a Japanese house: </p>
                <p>Remove your shoes before entering and put on the slippers left at the doorway. Leave your shoes
                    pointing away from the doorway you are about to walk through.</p>
                <p>Arrive on time or no more than 5 minutes late if invited for dinner. Unless you have been told the
                    event is casual, dress as if you were going into the office.</p>
                <p>If you use the toilet, put on the available toilet slippers and remove them when you are finished. Do
                    not wear them back out of the bathroom.</p>
                <p>Wait to be told where to sit. There is a protocol to be followed. The honoured guest or the eldest
                    person will be seated in the centre of the table the furthest from the door.</p>
                <p>The honoured guest or the eldest is the first person to begin eating.</p>
                <p>It will yield tremendous dividends if you learn to use chopsticks. Never point your chopsticks.
                    Chopsticks should be returned to the chopstick rest after every few bites and when you drink or stop
                    to speak. Do not cross your chopsticks when putting them on the chopstick rest.</p>
                <p>Don't be surprised if your Japanese colleagues slurp their noodles and soup.</p>
                <p>Mixing other food with rice is usually not done. You eat a bit of one and then a bit of the other,
                    but they should never be mixed together as you do in many Western countries.</p>
                <p>If you do not want anything more to drink, do not finish what is in your glass. An empty glass is an
                    invitation for someone to serve you more.</p>
                <p>If you leave a small amount of rice in your bowl, you will be given more. To signify that you do not
                    want more rice, finish every grain in your bowl.</p>
            </div>
            <dib id="customsCommuniction">
                <h4>Communication</h4>
                <p>The Japanese rely on facial expression, tone of voice and posture to tell them what someone feels.
                    They often trust non-verbal messages more than the spoken word as words can have several meanings.
                </p>
                <p>Frowning while someone is speaking is interpreted as a sign of disagreement. Most Japanese maintain
                    an impassive expression when speaking.</p>
                <p>Non-verbal communication is so vital that there is a book for 'gaijins' (foreigners) on how to
                    interpret the signs!</p>
                <p>It is considered disrespectful to stare into another person's eyes, particularly those of a person
                    who is senior to you because of age or status.</p>
                <p>In crowded situations the Japanese avoid eye contact to give themselves privacy.</p>
            </dib>
            <div id="customsGifts">
                <h4>Gift Giving</h4>
                <p>In Japan, gift-giving is highly ritualistic and meaningful. The ceremony of presenting the gift and
                    the way in which it is wrapped is as important, and sometimes more important, than the gift itself.
                </p>
                <p>Do not give lilies, camellias or lotus blossoms as they are associated with funerals and avoid white
                    flowers of any kind as they are associated with funerals.</p>
                <p>Do not give potted plants as they encourage sickness, although a bonsai tree is always acceptable.
                </p>
                <p>Give items in odd numbers, but not 9 (the numbers 9 and 4 are considered unlucky in Japan)</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-6">
            <h3 class="country-head">Business Etiquette</h3>
            <div id="business-basics">
                <p>Business cards are exchanged constantly and with great ceremony. Invest in quality cards.</p>
                <p>Treat the business card you receive as you would the person. It is wise to have one side of your
                    business card translated into Japanese.</p>
                <p>Business cards are given and received with two hands and a slight bow.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="customsDress">
                <h4>What to Wear</h4>
                <p>It is important to dress smartly and conservatively. Men should wear a dark suit in the winter months
                    with white shirt and tie that is not brightly coloured.</p>
                <p>As the summer months can be very hot it is acceptable to wear half sleeve shirts and light grey
                    suits.</p>
                <p>Women should also dress conservatively, wear hair either short or tied back. Conspicuous jewellery or
                    short skirts are not considered appropriate. </p>

            </div>

            <div id="customsMeetings">
                <h4>Meetings</h4>
                <p>Appointments are required and, whenever possible, should be made several weeks in advance.
                </p>
                <p>Punctuality is important. Arrive on time for meetings and expect your Japanese colleagues will do the
                    same.</p>
                <p>Since this is a group society, even if you think you will be meeting one person, be prepared for a
                    group meeting.</p>
                <p>The most senior Japanese person will be seated furthest from the door, with the rest of the people in
                    descending rank until the most junior person is seated closest to the door.</p>
                <p>It may take several meetings for your Japanese counterparts to become comfortable with you and be
                    able to conduct business with you. This initial getting to know you time is crucial to laying the
                    foundation for a successful relationship.</p>
                <p>Never refuse a request, no matter how difficult or non- profitable it may appear. The Japanese are
                    looking for a long-term relationship.</p>
                <p>Always provide a package of literature about your company including articles and client testimonials.
                </p>
                <p>Always give a small gift, as a token of your esteem, and present it to the most senior person at the
                    end of the meeting. Your Japanese contact can advise you on where to find something appropriate.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="CustomsPresentations">
                <h4>Presentations</h4>
                <p>Keep them formal and stick to the facts. Don’t try to impress with gimmicky designs.</p>
                <p>Materials should be handed to the participants of the meeting rather than the more casual practice of
                    ‘taking one and passing it on’.</p>
                <p>Make sure the time schedule allows for questions and remember, the Japanese do not always raise their
                    hands and will often look directly at you instead. It is up to the presenter to be aware and to
                    politely ask if they wish to ask a question.</p>

            </div>
            <div id="customsNegotiating">
                <h4>Negotiating</h4>
                <p>The Japanese are non-confrontational. They have a difficult time saying 'no', so you must be vigilant
                    at observing their non-verbal communication.</p>
                <p>It is best to phrase questions so that they can answer yes. For example, do you disagree with this?
                </p>
                <p>The Japanese often remain silent for long periods of time. Be patient and try to work out if your
                    Japanese colleagues have understood what was said.</p>
                <p>Japanese prefer broad agreements and mutual understanding so that when problems arise they can be
                    handled flexibly.</p>
                <p>Some Japanese close their eyes when they want to listen intently.</p>
                <p>The Japanese do not see contracts as final agreements so they can be renegotiated.</p>

                <h4>Greetings</h4>
                <p>A long but steady handshake is common. Ensure you only use your right hand.</p>
                <p>Arab men or women may decline to shake the hands of those from the other sex. This is a religious
                    adherence practiced by many male and female Muslims. It is not personal and it should not be taken
                    offensively. We suggest therefore, that men wait to see if a female offers her hand prior to
                    offering his. </p>
                <p>Likewise, if a female offers her hand and it is refused by a male, then we suggest the use of a
                    gesture that is often used across the Muslim world as an alternative greeting whereby the right hand
                    is placed flat over the heart, coupled with a brief nod of the head and a smile.</p>
                <p>It is polite to greet the oldest or most senior members of the group first.</p>
                <p>Maintain eye contact with people of the same sex.</p>
                <p>It is not uncommon for men to greet other men with a kiss or a nose rub. Male friends often link arms
                    or hold hands.</p>
                <p>Members of the opposite sex do not embrace or kiss in public.</p>

                <h4>Food</h4>
                <p>Dining in the UAE is a very social affair and can be a means to doing business also.</p>
                <p>It is considered polite to arrive fifteen minutes late.</p>
                <p>Expect to eat with the right hand – the left hand is considered dirty. However, if you are left
                    handed it is acceptable to eat with a utensil in the left hand. Arabs may eat with their hand only
                    and without utensils. Hand cleanliness is therefore very important. </p>
                <p>It is not considered polite to decline the offer of more food.</p>
                <p>If dining in a restaurant give more than the service charge – up to 10% is acceptable.</p>
            </div>

            <div id="customsTaboos">
                <h4>Taboos</h4>

                <p>Men should not stare at women or offer compliments</p>
                <p>Do not go outside scantily dressed</p>
                <p>Non-Muslims should not enter a mosque or touch a Qu’ran</p>
                <p>Kissing or cuddling in public is strictly prohibited and such conduct can result in arrest.</p>
                <p>Never give alcohol, pork products, knives or dog related items.</p>

            <h3 class="country-head">Business Etiquette</h3>
            <div id="business-basics">
                <p>Be aware that the work week in the UAE runs from Sunday to Thursday. Friday and Saturday are weekend
                    days.</p>
                <p>Government office hours are typically between 07:30 and 15:00, although private office hours are
                    typically open for longer and often finish as late as 21:00. However, where this is the case, a
                    three to four-hour break at some point in the day is given.</p>
                <p>Although timescales and deadlines are broadly adhered to, less priority is given to them compared to
                    Western cultures. If therefore, you are a Westerner doing business in the UAE, then you may wish to,
                    gently and politely, reinforce any deadlines.</p>
                <p>Do not question the boss in a way that puts him / her on the spot as this will potentially cause a
                    loss of face and will not be well received.</p>

            </div>
            <div id="customsDress">
                <h4>What to Wear</h4>
                <p>Dress conservatively. Men should wear a neat suit and tie.</p>
                <p>Women should dress smartly and modestly ensuring that their arms are covered regardless of
                    temperature.</p>
            </div>

            <div id="customsMeetings">
                <h4>Meetings</h4>
                <p>Punctuality is important and deemed respectful.</p>
                <p>It is not unusual for meetings to seem a little disorganised and interruptions are not uncommon. An
                    individual unrelated to the meeting may therefore join the meeting for a period and the subject may
                    change accordingly. You may also find that some individuals make or receive calls during the
                    meeting.</p>
                <p>The Emiratis expect formality and respect.</p>
                <p>Position is important and should be recognised.</p>
                <p>Expect to be addressed by your title and be sure to research the position and titles of those with
                    whom you do business.It is polite for instance, to address the head of the department or company as
                    ‘Sheikh’.</p>


            </div>
            <div id="customsNegotiating">
                <h4>Negotiating</h4>
                <p>Building relations in UAE and personal contacts are paramount to successful business. If you have not
                    taken the time and made the effort to build a positive relationship with your counterpart then it’s
                    unlikely that they will trust you sufficiently to negotiate with you.</p>
                <p>Any business agreements should be passed by a lawyer before signing on the dotted line.</p>
                <p>If there is some doubt about the outcome of negotiations this should not be expressed too negatively
                    and the word ‘no’ is best avoided.</p>
                <p>Do not use high pressure tactics as these will not be tolerated and are likely to negatively impact
                    proceedings.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="customsCommuniction">
                <h4>Communication</h4>
                <p>Small talk is common, indeed expected, and is often the prelude to business discussion.</p>
                <p>Business is conducted on the basis of trust in the UAE and will fall short if individuals try to
                    hurry on to business matters to hastily. Take the time to get to know your counterpart by asking
                    generic questions and showing an interest in them personally. Ask about their children, their
                    school, sporting interests, trips abroad etc. </p>
                <p>Be aware of hierarchal structures and show due respect to those in a higher position. Use titles
                    where appropriate.</p>
                <p>Never criticize Islam, the ruling classes or local traditions. Never sit in a position that shows the
                    soles of the feet. To do so is an insult as feet are considered dirty.</p>

                <h4>Greetings</h4>
                <p>When introduced expect to shake hands.</p>
                <p>Once a relationship is established, men may embrace and pat each other on the shoulder. Female

                <p>People are often referred to as Don or Dona and their first name when in formal occasion as a general
                    rule.</p>
                <p>Many men use a two-handed shake where the left hand is placed on the right forearm of the other

                <p>Spanish people are open and friendly. In an informal situation whether with family close friends or
                    virtual strangers they greet women with a kiss on each cheek.</p>
                <p>Men have no fear of personal space with other men in an informal situation and they will often greet
                    or say good-bye with a hug (abrazo).</p>

                <p>Do not begin eating until the hostess starts. The host gives the first toast. An honoured guest
                    should return the toast later in the meal.</p>
                <p>Indicate you have finished eating by laying your knife and fork parallel on your plate, tines facing
                    up, with the handles facing to the right.</p>

                <p>When addressing a professional then use titles where appropriate (e.g. doctor / professor). It is not

                <p>Decisions are not necessarily reached. Meetings are for discussion and to exchange ideas.</p>
                <p>Most Spaniards do not give their opinion at meetings. Therefore, it is important to watch their

                <p>Spaniards do not like to lose face, so they will not necessarily say that they do not understand
                    something, particularly if you are not speaking Spanish. You must be adept at discerning body
                    language.</p>
                <p>Spaniards are very thorough. They will review every minute detail to make certain it is understood.

                <p>Spanish people are proud and very protective of their standing and how others perceive them.</p>
                <p>Boasting of achievement and personal accomplishment should be avoided.</p>
                <p>Spanish people tend to be extrovert and friendly as is typical in Mediterranean culture and they

                <h4>Meetings</h4>
                <p>Appointments are necessary and should be made as far in advance as possible.</p>
                <p>It often takes roughly 6 weeks to arrange a meeting with a government official.</p>
                <p>The first week of May has several public holidays so it is best avoided.</p>
                <p>The first meeting is often a vehicle to determine if you and the company you represent are credible and worthy of consideration for future business dealings.</p>
                <p>Russians expect long and detailed presentations that include a history of the subject and a review of existing precedents.</p>
                <p>Meetings are frequently interrupted. It is common for several side conversations that have nothing to do with the topic of the meeting to be carried on during the meeting.</p>
                <p>At the end of the meeting, expect to sign a 'protokol', which is a summary of what was discussed.</p>

            <div id="customsCommuniction">
                <h4>Communication</h4>
                <p>Russians are transactional and do not need to establish long-standing personal relationships before they do business with people. It is still a good idea to develop a network of people who you know and trust. The Russian word "svyasi" means connections and refers to having friends in high places, which is often required to cut through red tape.</p>
                <p>Patience is essential.</p>
                <p>Sincerity is crucial as it is required to build trust, and trust is needed to build a relationship.
                </p>
                <p>Most Russians do not trust people who are 'all business'.</p>
                <p>An indication that you have successfully developed a personal relationship is being asked for a favour by that person.</p>

            </div>
            <div id="customsNegotiating">
                <h4>Negotiating</h4>
                <p>Meetings and negotiations are slow. Russians do not like being rushed.</p>
                <p>It is a good idea to include technical experts on your negotiating team.</p>
                <p>Hierarchy is important to Russians. They respect age, rank and position. The most senior person reaches decisions. Russian executives prefer to meet with people of similar rank and position.</p>
                <p>Russians see negotiations as win-lose. They do not believe in win-win scenarios.</p>
                <p>Russians view compromise as weakness. They will continue negotiating until you offer concessions.</p>
                <p>Russians may lose their temper, walk out of the meeting, or threaten to terminate the relationship in an attempt to coerce you to change your position.</p>
                <p>Russians often use time as a tactic, especially if they know that you have a deadline. Be cautious about letting your business colleagues know that you are under time pressure or they will delay even more.</p>
                <p>Nothing is final until the contract is signed. Even then, Russians will modify a contract to suit their purposes.</p>
                <p>Do not use high-pressure sales tactics as they will work against you.</p>
